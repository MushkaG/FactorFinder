# FactorFinder
This program will give you the correct pair of factors to use for factoring out any quadratic trinomial. 
You use it by entring in the values of all three coeffecients/constants in the trinomial, labeled a, b & c. For example,in the trinomial "2k^2 + 22k + 60", the A value would be 2, the B value would be 22, and the C value would be 60.
This program will calculate the value of A times C, and will then go through all the factors of that number, stopping when the sum of both factors equals the B value. It will print that pair on the screen. 
This program was written in C, and was made in the cs50 IDE.
